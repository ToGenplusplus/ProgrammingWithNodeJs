- The OS kernel is the parent process of all child processes
  - kernel is the core of the operating system
  - it provides an interface to hardware devices as well as to process, memory and I/O management
  - it manages request from users via system calls that switch the process from users space to kernel space
  - all processes run on top of the kernel
  - the shell is one important process that run on top of the kernel
  - the shell eposes an interface that enables users to issue system calls to interact with the os kernel
- Unix shells:
  - UNIX executables files
  - bash and zsh two most popular
  - /bin holds executable files
  - in Mac: /usr/local/bin can be used to hold custom unix executables
  - list of available shells can be found in /etc/shells
  - Terminal application opens a shell as a sub process
  - when you run an application in the shell (e.g node), this spins up a new sub process with the parent process being the shell
- Bash shell
  - exectuion order:
    - Aliases => functions => built in functions => path
  - To see the type of a command in bash we can run:
    - `type {command}`
  - PATH global variable
    - accesed in shell using $PATH
    - string consisting of different paths in computer separated by a :
  - Login Shell
    - type of shell that runs some configuration files to properly setup the shell environment
    - Will run the following files in order:
      - /etc/profile
      - ~/.bash_profile
        - will run ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile if bash_profile is not found
      - ~/.bashrc - only fle that gets ran for non-login shell
- ZSH (like bash but with more features)
  - Login Shell
    - Will run the following files in order:
      - ~/.zprofile
      - ~/.zshrc - only fle that gets ran for non-login shell
- Process
  - every process is a child process of the unix kernel
  - every process has a process id (PID) and parent process id (PPID)
  - `echo $$` - see the PID for the current shell
  - `echo $PPID` - set the PPID for the current shell
  - When a new process is created, the parent process passes to the child process some things.
    - E.g bash running a node process, bash will pass to node:
      - env variables
      - command line arguments
      - current working directory
- Interprocess communication (IPC)
  - unix concept
  - communicating between two processes on a sinlge machine using unix domain sockets
  - usually more performant than networking communication
  - Data is being moved around in the RAM (does not deal with any netoworking interfaces i.e network card on the computer)
