# Networking

Basics

- Network Card - defines the MAC address (48 bits - hexadecimal)
- Switch - allows computers within the same network to communicate with each other
  using cables and the MAC addresses.
- Router - used to route data from one network to another. They are identified by IP addresses. Each router will assign each computer attached to itself a unique IP address.
